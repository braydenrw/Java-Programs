This generates a Maze of any specified size with a random entry point
and exit point.

The maze is generated through a depth first search and randomly removes walls
to form a maze from left to right of any dimensions greater than 5x5.  The
program writes a 2d array with integer values 1-15 that represent the walls that
are present and those that are not.  The file also has the width and height as the
first two integers shown.

To run this file set the run configurations to the width height and name of the
file you will write to.  There is a Perl script provided that renders the maze from
the file that was written within this .jar.

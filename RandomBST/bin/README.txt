RandomBSTSymbolTable.java, README.txt

Creates a BST Symbol Table that inserts at the root and can delete a
Node at any point in the tree.

This program will create a 100 Node BST Symbol table that has the ability to
search, insert, and remove Nodes from the tree.  The search will give the user
the value held in the node that is associated with its key, insert will insert
new Nodes at the root of the tree, and remove will remove whatever value the
user provides.

Run the RandomBSTSymbolTable.java to produce a tree.svg file that contains
the bst, you can then open this in a browser to view the tree.  You can also
import plain text files and those may be set in a tree.
